## Task

The Little Lemon restaurant has decided to remove all desserts with high calories from their menu.

In this lab, I implemented a new list component, `DessertsList`, that will display a list of desserts with less than 500 calories, all sorted by calories, from low to high.

The `App` component passes that information to the `DessertsList` component as a prop named `dessert`.

Each item from the list displays the name of the dessert and the number of calories, both separated by a dash character, i.e. `Chocolate Mousse - 250 cal`.
